#
# Threshold used by the page cache to decide how the page cache is cleared.
# If the number of invalidation keywords defined in a cache clear process 
# for a site exceeds this threshold a full page cache invalidation is done 
# instead of a keywords based invalidation. The default value is 0 which
# means a keywords based invalidation is always done. This property
# can be overwritten domain-specific. Usually this correlates somehow
# with the number of products available for a domain.
