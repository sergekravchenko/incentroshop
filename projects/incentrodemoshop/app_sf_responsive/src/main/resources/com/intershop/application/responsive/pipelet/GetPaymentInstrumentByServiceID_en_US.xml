<description>Resolves the payment instrument for a payment service which has no data stored in a property group and therefor only occur once at the basket. In assumption that it is useful to validate user entered data, the absence of the &apos;Validate&apos; capability is used to detect if this approach is feasible.
(Payment instruments that implement the &quot;Validate&quot; capability are responsible for themselves.)

If no matching payment service was found for the given ID, or no instrument is found at the basket
the error exit will be taken. </description>
